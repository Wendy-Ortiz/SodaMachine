# SODA VENDING MACHINE
Development of the second exam for the software engineering course. 

create a web system of a soda vending machine. It should not create a database, but it should simulate one in the sense that all data must be in memory. You should only design one screen and you should not generate extra configuration screens, only one that meets the requirements of the following user stories:
1. As a consumer I want to see the soft drinks that are available in the machine to be able to choose which ones I want.
2. As a consumer, I want to be able to enter the amount of soft drinks of each type that I want to be able to make a purchase.
3. As a consumer I want to be able to enter the amount of money I want to enter into the system.
4. As a consumer, I want to be notified of the change when making my purchase so that I can know what the final result of the purchase is.
